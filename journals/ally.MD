Today, I worked on:

* Getting patients's list, updating patient's detail and create a patient

I wrote some postgresql and utilized FastAPI framework to test out the backend codes.
I faced some difficulties to see my table in the database and I was getting a syntax error in api/migrations/__main__.py folder but actually the issue was an extra comma in the api/migrations/001_patient_table.py. I was so amazed by how an error can be in a different file as to the error message but also made a mental note to double check my work before running it. 
I also had to run <export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM="linux/amd64"> initially when I faced an OperationalError: connection failed: SCRAM authentication requires libpq version 10 or above.
